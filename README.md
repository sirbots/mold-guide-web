# About this Project

This code is for a website that I'm building in my free time. It's a site dedicated to providing resources to help people who have been exposed to toxic mold and fallen ill as a result.

It's built with Next.js 13 and uses both server- and client-side rendering. The database is MongoDB, connected via Prisma. Images are generated with MidJourney.

It's deployed via Netlify at [TheMoldGuide.com](https://themoldguide.com).

I'm making it public because I wanted to show that I can make full-stack sites using modern React-based frameworks.
